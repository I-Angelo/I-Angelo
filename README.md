## About me

I attended Florida Atlantic University for Computer Science, and most recently, I earned my certificate of completion in Computer Software Engineer at Coding Temple. 

My passion has been from a young age to learn how computer and softwares work and interact with one another. I am currently looking to continue my career as a Software Developer with an organization in which I can expand my knowledge and be able to contribute to the company's growth.
